                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1961 Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Falke gave 28
                    acres of beautiful mountain land near the Schoharie Creek in Lexington
                    N.Y. for the establishment of a Christian Camp. The Camp was to be used
                    by churches within the brotherhood of Independent Christian Churches/Churches of
                    Christ to help them promote New Testament Christianity in the N.Y.
                    metropolitan area. The camp became known as the Catskill Christian
                    Assembly (CCA)
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the primary goals of the CCA is to
                    introduce people to Jesus Christ and to subsequently reinforce their
                    faith in him. To accomplish this there are many camp weeks and retreats
                    for both young people and adults throughout the year. Teaching and
                    preaching the Gospel are highest on the list of CCA activities but there
                    are many other leisure time activities which are beneficial to those who
                    are looking for a change of pace from the hum drum world of the
                    metropolitan area. Some of these activities include hiking, fishing,
                    softball, volleyball, ping pong, campfires, etc. The fellowship of
                    common believers at CCA is also an invaluable resource for churches
                    within the brotherhood, especially those who are small and sometimes
                    feel isolated in the big city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CCA is licensed by the New York State
                    Dept. of Health. The N.Y.S. Dept. of Health inspects the CCA twice each
                    year and records of these inspections are on file in the camp office.
                    CCA is open to all persons regardless of race, color, or national
                    origin. CCA is owned and operated by the Christian Churches/Churches of
                    Christ of the N.Y. metropolitan area.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The camp facilities are available for use by
                    our sponsoring churches, Bible school groups and individual families
                    when camp activities are not scheduled. For further information call the
                    camp manager Kenny Aurigema at 518-299-3611.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a few years, a campsite at Lebanon, New
                    Jersey had been rented in which to conduct Christian Camp. In 1959, an
                    outbreak of a typhoid-like illness closed the canp. The following year,
                    Camp was conducted at Epachiseca, near Stillwater, Pa. A Camp of our own
                    was clearly needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1961 Joseph and Else Falke, members of
                    the church in Maspeth, Queens, donated 27 acres of beautiful land in the
                    Catskill Mountains, adjacent to their summer home, just west of
                    Prattsville, NY. 160 miles from New York City.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All during the spring and summer of 1961,
                    ministers from the 8 churches and crews of men under the direction of
                    Ralph Byers, minister art E. Northport and Mr. Falke, himself a
                    contractor, worked doggedly to build the first unit - a concrete block
                    structure which would house the dining and chapel areas. plans were made
                    to build small dormitories for the campers later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of stringent NY State laws, it was
                    assumed a full year of construction would be needed to ready the camp
                    for occupancy in 1962.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final week of August, 1961, five Go Ye Chapel
                    ministers and their families spent the entire week at the campsite,
                    working on the building.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Sunday morning, Sept 3rd, the first church
                    meeting was conducted at the camp by E.C. Kile, with 38 in attendance.
                    Five persons accepted Christ and were immersed that afternoon in the
                    Schohaire Creek below the camp.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Camp Program was indeed begun in 1962,
                    with David Miller, minister of the Glen Cove Christian Church acting as
                    part-time manager.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main building was completed including
                    the kitchen, dining and chapel area, complete with a floor to ceiling
                    stone fireplace, constructed from stones from the property of Reavis
                    Staggs, a member of East Northport. The building included 3 rooms for
                    the manager, the nurse and cooks, a bath, and a basement for storage of
                    food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two dormitories &quot;up the hill&quot; were ready. A bath house
                    with 2 additional rooms for faculty had been built below the main
                    building, and a leeching field and septic tank were in place. Electric
                    lines were run. Funds for the building of the camp were provided by the
                    area churches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Campsite officially became Catskill
                    Christian Assembly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the first camp season spring water
                    was brought up daily from the Falke farm by truck in milk cans. In
                    subsequent years, water was tapped. But the high content of sulfur in the
                    water eventually necessitated filtering equipment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; By the summer of 1963, the camp's second year of
                    operation, there were a total of 93 students in the 3 weeks of camp with
                    32 faculty members assisting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, an addition would be built onto the
                    main building which would house faculty members and older campers coming
                    for Family Week, nurses quarters with a separate bath, 2 extra
                    bathrooms, and an outdoor lounging porch. Falke Chapel would be built, 2
                    more dormitories would go up, and electricity would be installed in the
                    dormitories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David Miller would leave his ministry
                    in the area&nbsp;to become full-time manager, And crews of men would continue
                    to donate their time through the years, so that hundreds of campers
                    would have the chance to come closer to God here in the beauty of His
                    creation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inner-City kids would know the joy of quietness
                    and peace away from the crowded, hot, dirty city streets; and the camp
                    would have a full summer schedule, beginning the end of June through the
                    end of August. At all times during the Fall and Spring, various groups
                    and churches would conduct their own retreats at Catskill Christian
                    Assembly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The church at Maspeth, home congregation of the
                    Falkes, would continue to support the camp over years, both in interest
                    and financial help, The Nesconset Church would send crews of men up each
                    Spring, under the direction of John Vion, to make major constructional
                    and aesthetic improvements to meet the requirements of the laws of New
                    York State.

                            (Buddy) Sarno :
                        </strong>First of all, before the camp was even here
                        <i>&lt;unclear&gt;</i> the property was
                        donated before there was a road to come up here
                        <i>&lt;interruption&gt;</i> in order to
                        <i>&lt;interruption&gt;</i> and the cement
                        blocks needed to be brought up there. We had to carry them from the road
                        up here 2 at a time and that went on every single week, every Saturday and
                        we would get up 4 or 5 o’clock in the morning and get up here 8 or 9 o’clock and work all day until dark and then get back in the car
                        and go home to get up and go to church the next morning. The dedication
                        of the individuals that were willing to sacrifice.. and that’s the
                        word.. sacrifice their time, their talents and their vacations…. ok?
                        vacations!….to come up here and work..
                        <i>&lt;tapping on table&gt; &lt;unclear&gt;</i>….we had to do it with 5 people that built these
                        buildings… we did not have an organization such that we got now. We had
                        a couple of people <i>&lt;unclear&gt;</i>
                        individuals who did it.<o:p></o:p>

                        got to have a senior work week. We have to be able to get 20 to 25
                        teenagers.. men, boys but may be one or 2 men to sacrifice their time
                        and their vacations to come up here and work. When we first started to
                        clean the bathrooms we needed a chisel.... I kid you not. Scrapers and
                        a toothbrush in order to get it clean. First year, second year we did
                        the same thing. The third year, the girls said we want to go. Daddy?..
                        Do you want to come? Yes. You work as hard as the boys. When they came
                        up, we gave them a chisel and worked side by side.. they complained a
                        little bit...with clothe pins on their noses...but that’s the only way
                        they are going to do it. I heard it as said, the bathrooms are terrible.
                        They couldn’t be any worse than what they were… but you’re not going to
                        clean them with five people. <o:p></o:p>

                        it and they can come and they can sue me. Unless the minister is
                        enthusiastic about the camp, the camp is not going to work. Unless the
                        ministers are enthused about it, nobody is going to be enthused about
                        it. Not just an associate minister, I’m talking about the senior
                        ministers. That’s the only way it is going to work. He’s got to get up
                        there Sunday morning and say, “Man you got through this again. We have

                        enthusiastic leadership under the church in order to rub off on the
                        teenagers in the

                    <strong>Modesto (Buddy) Sarno :</strong> You know what, I would like to
                    use this and give them to a teenager…Give it to a teenager who really excels… working for the Lord here at Catskill Christian Assembly. Make a little plaque….<unclear>
                        hang it up… I don’t care what you do with it. But it is only going to
                        work if we go back to our churches with an enthusiastic attitude about what is needed to happen here at Catskill Christian Assembly. And you know what? It’s only going to happen if that happens. You can say all you want but I believe very strongly what Pete (O’Leary) said. That if you don’t, you can close the doors in five years. I have watched the camp and have participated in the camp for many years. When did it start? 1961? .. Ok… 1961 and the last time I was able to get here was two years ago for the Men’s Retreat… It’s gotta improve and the only way it’s gonna improve is if we go back and go back and get our team so enthusiastic about coming to camp. The only way to get them enthusiastic you guys at this camp. I’m going to leave it…<unclear>
